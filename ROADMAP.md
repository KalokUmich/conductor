  - GIT_ASKPASS token authentication
  - FileSystemProvider (`conductor://` URI scheme)
  - WorkspacePanel 5-step creation wizard
  - WorkspaceClient typed HTTP client
  - Workspace code search (`GET /workspace/{room_id}/search`)
- **Agentic Code Intelligence**:
  - `AgentLoopService` — LLM-driven iterative tool loop (up to 25 iterations, 500K token budget)
  - 24 code tools: `grep`, `read_file`, `list_files`, `find_symbol`, `find_references`, `file_outline`, `get_dependencies`, `get_dependents`, `git_log` (+ `search=`), `git_diff`, `ast_search`, `get_callees`, `get_callers`, `git_blame`, `git_show`, `find_tests`, `test_outline`, `trace_variable`, `compressed_view`, `module_summary`, `expand_symbol`, `run_test`
  - 3-layer system prompt: Core Identity + Strategy (by query type) + Runtime Guidance
  - Query classifier: keyword matching (default) or LLM pre-classification (Haiku)
  - Dynamic tool sets: 8-12 tools per query type (reduces LLM confusion)
  - Token-based budget controller with convergence signals
  - `trace_variable` — data flow tracing with alias detection, argument→parameter mapping, sink/source patterns
  - Workspace reconnaissance — auto-scan project layout + project marker detection
  - `chat_with_tools()` on all 3 AI providers (Bedrock Converse, Anthropic Messages, OpenAI)
  - `POST /api/context/query` — general code Q&A with agentic loop
  - `POST /api/context/explain-rich` — deep code explanation via agent (replaces XML-prompt pipeline)
  - SSE streaming (`POST /api/context/query/stream`, `/explain-rich/stream`) for real-time progress
- **RepoMap (Graph-based Symbol Index)**:
  - tree-sitter AST parsing for symbol extraction (used by `find_symbol`, `file_outline`, dependency tools)
  - File dependency graph (networkx) with PageRank ranking

Optimizations guided by OpenAI review and academic research (ICLR 2026, MutaGReP, DraCo, LingmaAgent, RAG-Gym).

#### Token-Based Budget Controller (COMPLETE)
- [x] `TokenUsage` dataclass in `ai_provider/base.py` — extracted from all 3 providers (Bedrock, Anthropic Direct, OpenAI)
- [x] `BudgetController` in `agent_loop/budget.py` — tracks cumulative input/output tokens per session
- [x] Three budget signals: `NORMAL`, `WARN_CONVERGE` (70% threshold or diminishing returns), `FORCE_CONCLUDE` (90% threshold or max iterations)
- [x] Diminishing returns detection: if last N iterations found no new files or symbols, signal convergence
- [x] File/symbol tracking: `track_file()` / `track_symbol()` for dedup-aware progress monitoring

- Reference: [RAG-Gym — Process Supervision for Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13957)

#### Tool Output Policy (COMPLETE)

- [x] Integrated into `AgentLoopService.run_stream()` alongside existing `_is_high_level_query`
- [x] Optional LLM pre-classification via `classify_query_with_llm()` using lightweight model (Haiku) — ~100ms, ~$0.001 per call
- [x] Configurable in `conductor.settings.yaml` via `classifier.use_llm` and `classifier.model_id`
- [x] Falls back to keyword matching on LLM failure

#### Symbol Role Classification (COMPLETE)
- [x] Classify symbols into 7 roles: route_entry, business_logic, domain_model, infrastructure, utility, test, unknown
- [x] 3-tier classification: decorator/annotation context (reads 5 lines above symbol) → file path patterns → name patterns
- [x] `find_symbol` results sorted by role priority: route_entry > business_logic > domain_model > infrastructure > utility > test > unknown
- [x] Within same role, exact name matches before substring matches

- [x] Layer 1: Core Identity (~100 lines) — always included: hard constraints, exploration pattern, answer format
- [x] Layer 2: Strategy (~30 lines) — selected by query classifier: 7 strategies (entry_point, flow_tracing, root_cause, impact, architecture, config, data_lineage)
- [x] Layer 3: Runtime Guidance — injected dynamically by service.py: budget context, scatter warnings, convergence checkpoints
- [x] Prompt compressed from ~7500 to ~4000 tokens per LLM call
- [x] Removed redundant tool descriptions (already in TOOL_DEFINITIONS)
- [x] Removed contradictory rules (e.g. "NEVER 3 greps" vs "maximize parallelism")
- [x] `build_system_prompt()` accepts `query_type` to select Layer 2 strategy
- [x] Accumulated text trimming — keeps only last 3 thinking turns to limit context growth
- [x] Budget hard constraints at WARN_CONVERGE — refuses new broad searches, only allows verification calls
- [x] 39 tests in `test_agent_loop.py` (including strategy selection by query type)

  - Check 3: agent must have accessed ≥ 1 file
- [x] If evidence insufficient AND budget remains (≥ 2 iterations), reject the answer and inject guidance forcing the LLM to investigate further
- [x] Graceful degradation: if no budget remains, let the weak answer through
- [x] Integrated into `AgentLoopService.run_stream()` at the "Final answer" checkpoint
- [x] 14 tests in `test_evidence.py`

- [x] `workflow/router.py` — 5 REST endpoints: `GET /api/workflows`, `GET /api/workflows/{name}`, `GET /api/workflows/{name}/mermaid`, `GET /api/workflows/{name}/graph`, `PUT /api/workflows/{name}/models`
- [x] Config files: `config/workflows/pr_review.yaml` (6 routes, parallel_all_matching), `config/workflows/code_explorer.yaml` (9 routes, first_match, includes `delegate` to pr_review)
- [x] 17 agent `.md` files in `config/agents/` — 5 PR explorer agents, 2 PR judge agents, 3 code explorer multi-agent, 7 code explorer single-agent routes
- [x] 2 shared prompt templates in `config/prompts/` — `review_base.md`, `explorer_base.md`

- [x] "Workflows" tab in AI Config modal for explorer/judge model selection per workflow

#### Cross-Session Query Patterns (PLANNED)
Analyze session traces to learn from past queries and improve future performance.
- [ ] Build `query_patterns.json` from offline analysis of session traces
- [ ] Track common entry points, hot modules, and effective tool strategies per query type
- [ ] Feed historical data back into Query Classifier — bias initial tool selection toward patterns that worked
- [ ] Warm-start the budget controller based on observed token costs for similar queries
- Reference: [RAG-Gym — Process Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13957)

#### Multi-Agent Collaboration (PLANNED — long-term)
Split the single-agent loop into specialized sub-agents for complex queries.
- [ ] Navigator Agent (Haiku) — decompose complex questions into sub-tasks + assign strategies
- [ ] Explorer Agent (Sonnet) — execute sub-tasks, collect evidence, call tools
- [ ] Critic Agent (Haiku) — verify completeness, identify gaps, suggest follow-ups
- [ ] Final synthesis by Navigator aggregating Explorer outputs
- [ ] Shared evidence store across sub-agents (avoid duplicate tool calls)
- Reference: [MANTRA — 82.8% success rate with multi-agent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15872)

#### Architecture Analyzer (PLANNED)
Higher-level architectural analysis beyond individual file dependencies.
- [ ] Generate service dependency graph from RepoMap v2 edges
- [ ] Detect cyclic dependencies (strongly connected components in import graph)
- [ ] Identify layer violations (e.g., controller importing repository directly, skipping service layer)
- [ ] Dead code detection (PageRank ≈ 0 + zero references)
- [ ] Output as structured JSON for visualization in WebView

#### Side Effect Analyzer Enhancement (PLANNED)
Extend `trace_variable` with richer sink/source detection.
- [ ] User-configurable sink/source patterns via `.conductor/sink_patterns.yaml`
- [ ] Confidence levels: "confirmed" (pattern match + AST verification) vs "probable" (pattern only)
- [ ] Cross-file flow continuation: auto-chain `trace_variable` across function boundaries
- [ ] Extended sink patterns: message queues (Kafka, RabbitMQ), cache writes (Redis), event emit

### 5.5.1 Cross-Layer / Cross-Service Tracing
Today the agent traces dependencies within a single service. The next frontier is answering:

> "A user clicks 'Apply for More Credit' in the TypeScript frontend — which Python services are invoked, what SQL is ultimately run, and which database tables are written?"

This requires the agent to follow HTTP client calls across language boundaries (TypeScript → Python → SQL), map REST endpoints to their handler functions, and connect repository/ORM calls to concrete table operations.

- [ ] Cross-language call graph: TypeScript `fetch`/axios → FastAPI endpoint → service → DB
- [ ] HTTP endpoint registry (map URL patterns to handler functions across repos)
- [ ] ORM/query layer tracing (SQLAlchemy, Prisma, raw SQL detection)
- [ ] Multi-repo workspace support (agent can span more than one git worktree)
- [ ] "Request lifecycle" tool that assembles the full chain in one answer

### 5.5.2 Persistent Codebase Memory
Currently every `explain-rich` request starts from zero — the agent re-explores the same modules every time. Pre-building a module-level summary index would give the agent "working memory":

> "This file's responsibility is X, it depends on Y, it is called by Z."

The agent then skips basic exploration and immediately targets the relevant code.

- [ ] Background indexer: generate per-file summaries after workspace creation
- [ ] Store summaries in a lightweight key-value store (e.g. SQLite, Redis)
- [ ] Inject relevant summaries into the agent's initial context
- [ ] Incremental refresh on file change (watch worktree for edits)
- [ ] Cache invalidation on git pull / branch switch

### 5.5.3 Heuristic Data Flow Tracing (COMPLETE)
The `trace_variable` tool enables tracking how a value flows through function call boundaries:

> "How does `loan_id` flow from the HTTP request body, through service and repository layers, and into the final SQL WHERE clause?"

The agent chains `trace_variable` calls — each hop's `flows_to` output becomes the next hop's input.

- [x] `trace_variable` tool — single-hop analysis with alias detection, argument→parameter mapping
- [x] Forward direction: detect where a value flows to (call sites + sinks)
- [x] Backward direction: detect where a value comes from (callers + sources)
- [x] Alias detection: transitive `x = var; y = x` tracking within function bodies
- [x] Argument-to-parameter mapping: resolve callee definitions, map positional/keyword args to formal params
- [x] Sink pattern library: ORM `.filter()`/`.where()`, JPA `findBy*()`, SQL `execute()`, HTTP body, return, log
- [x] Source pattern library: HTTP `request.json`/`req.body`, annotations (`@RequestParam`, `@PathVariable`), config, DB result
- [x] Multi-language: Python, Java, TypeScript/JavaScript
- [x] Agent prompt strategy for chaining hops and verifying low-confidence connections
- [x] 15 tests covering forward/backward tracing, alias detection, param mapping, sink/source detection

#### Current limitations (heuristic approach)
| Limitation | Description |
|---|---|
| **Complex control flow aliases** | `if cond: x = loan_id` / `else: x = other` — can't tell which branch |
| **Higher-order functions** | `map(process, loans)` — can't trace into lambdas/closures |
| **Dynamic dispatch** | Interface → implementation resolution requires type inference |
| **Container shape tracking** | `data = {"id": loan_id}` → `data["id"]` across function boundaries |
| **Cross-language boundaries** | TS `fetch("/api/loans")` → Python `@app.post("/api/loans")` — URL pattern match only |
| **Framework magic** | DI containers, middleware chains, decorators that transform arguments |

### 5.5.4 Precise Static Taint Analysis (PLANNED — long-term)
Moving from heuristic regex+AST to CodeQL-level precision. This is a **research direction**, not a near-term deliverable.

> Goal: fully automated, sound taint tracking from source (HTTP input) to sink (SQL/ORM/external API) with zero false negatives and minimal false positives.

#### Required infrastructure
- [ ] SSA-form intermediate representation — transform each function into Static Single Assignment form where every variable is assigned exactly once. This is the foundation for precise alias analysis. Requires a proper AST → IR lowering pass per language (tree-sitter AST is not sufficient; need control flow graph construction).
- [ ] Inter-procedural type inference — resolve dynamic dispatch (`interface.method()` → concrete class), generics (`List<Loan>.get()` → `Loan`), and overloaded methods. Requires type constraint propagation (Hindley-Milner style for TypeScript, flow-sensitive for Java/Python).
- [ ] Taint propagation engine — forward/backward dataflow analysis over the call graph. Each statement is a transfer function: assignments propagate taint, sanitizers kill taint, transformers modify taint labels. Needs fixed-point iteration over the call graph (worklist algorithm).
- [ ] Framework-specific models — pre-built summaries for common frameworks:
  - FastAPI/Flask/Django: `request.json["key"]` is a taint source; `Response(data)` is a sink
  - Spring Boot: `@RequestBody` → taint source; `JpaRepository.save()` → sink
  - Express/NestJS: `req.body.field` → source; `res.json()` → sink
  - SQLAlchemy/Prisma/Hibernate: `.filter()`, `.execute()`, `.query()` → sinks
- [ ] Cross-language bridge — for `TypeScript → HTTP → Python` hops:
  - Parse OpenAPI/Swagger/GraphQL schema definitions as bridge contracts
  - Match `fetch("/api/loans", {body: {loan_id}})` to `@app.post("/api/loans") def handler(body: LoanRequest)`
  - Propagate taint labels across the HTTP boundary using field name matching
- [ ] Incremental analysis — re-analyze only changed files + their transitive dependents (not the whole codebase). Requires a dependency-aware invalidation cache.

#### Reference implementations to study
- **CodeQL** (GitHub/Semmle): the gold standard. Full SSA, inter-procedural, 20+ language support. But requires compilation database + offline analysis.
- **Semgrep** (r2c): pattern-based with limited inter-procedural support. Good for single-file taint rules but weak on cross-function flows.
- **Joern** (ShiftLeft): Code Property Graph — combines AST + CFG + PDG. Works on C/C++/Java/Python. Open-source.
- **WALA** (IBM): Java/JavaScript static analysis framework with SSA and points-to analysis.

#### Estimated effort
This is a **multi-quarter R&D effort** requiring compiler engineering expertise. The SSA construction alone is ~2-3 person-months per language. The pragmatic path is to incrementally improve the heuristic tool while researching whether integrating with an existing engine (CodeQL or Joern) is viable for our architecture.

## Architecture Decision Log

### ADR-001: Model A over Model B for initial workspace
**Decision**: Implement Model A (PAT token via GIT_ASKPASS) first.
**Rationale**: Simpler to implement, test, and debug. Model B requires the extension to proxy Git operations, adding significant complexity. Model A validates the core workspace isolation design.
**Status**: Implemented in Phase 4.

### ADR-002: FileSystemProvider over SFTP/SCP
**Decision**: Use VS Code `FileSystemProvider` API with `conductor://` URI scheme.
**Rationale**: Native VS Code integration without SSH infrastructure. Files appear in the file explorer, search, and editor just like local files.
**Status**: Implemented in Phase 4.

### ADR-003: WorkspacePanel over WebView wizard
**Decision**: Use native VS Code `InputBox` / `QuickPick` for workspace creation.
**Rationale**: No CSP configuration needed. Integrates with VS Code themes. Feels native compared to a WebView form.
**Status**: Implemented in Phase 4.

### ADR-004: Per-room worktrees over shared workspace
**Decision**: Each session room gets its own Git branch (`session/{room_id}`) and worktree.
**Rationale**: Isolates concurrent sessions. Allows independent commit history per room. Simplifies conflict detection.
**Status**: Implemented in Phase 4.

### ADR-005: Inline search panel over separate view
**Decision**: Workspace code search opens in an inline WebView panel with `Ctrl+Shift+F`.
**Rationale**: Familiar keyboard shortcut. Keeps search results visible alongside code. No need for a separate VS Code sidebar view.
**Status**: Implemented in Phase 4.2.

### ADR-009: Aider-style RepoMap for graph-based context
**Decision**: Use tree-sitter AST parsing + networkx dependency graph + PageRank for file importance ranking.
**Rationale**: Vector search finds semantically similar code but misses structural context. The dependency graph identifies files that are structurally important (heavily imported, central to architecture) even if they don't contain text matching the query. Personalised PageRank bridges the two: bias towards files from vector search, then expand via graph.
**Status**: Implemented in Phase 4.5.3.

### ADR-013: Unified credential injection with setdefault()
**Decision**: `_inject_embedding_env_vars()` now injects ALL available credentials at startup using `os.environ.setdefault()` instead of only injecting the active backend's credentials with direct assignment.
**Rationale**: With LiteLLM, the active backend is determined by the model string prefix, not a separate `embedding_backend` field. Injecting all available credentials means any model string works without config changes. Using `setdefault()` ensures pre-existing environment variables (from IAM roles, instance profiles, or CI) are never silently overwritten.
**Status**: Implemented in Phase 4.5.2.

### ADR-014: Agentic tool loop over RAG pipeline for code context
**Decision**: Replace the vector search → rerank → graph RAG pipeline with an LLM agent loop (`AgentLoopService`) that iteratively calls code-intelligence tools to gather context.
**Rationale**: RAG pipelines are passive — they retrieve pre-indexed chunks and hope the relevant code was indexed at the right granularity. An agent is active: it decides what to read next based on what it has already seen, follows import chains, reads function implementations, and checks who calls what. This enables cross-file reasoning (e.g. tracing a Protocol to its concrete implementation, or finding where a DI container resolves a dependency) that vector similarity cannot replicate. The trade-off is higher latency (up to 10–15 LLM calls per query) vs. a single retrieval + generation pass — acceptable for an on-demand "Explain" action where depth matters more than speed. The RepoMap (ADR-009) is retained as a structural index powering the `find_symbol`, `file_outline`, and dependency tools used by the agent.
**Status**: Implemented in Phase 4.6.

### ADR-015: Integration Token Store — Postgres with SQLAlchemy async
**Decision**: Store OAuth tokens for external integrations (Jira, Teams, Slack) in a shared Postgres instance (the Langfuse database server, port 5433) using SQLAlchemy async, with an `integration_tokens` table keyed by `(user_email, provider)`.
**Rationale**: Postgres over SQLite for consistency with the existing Langfuse infrastructure, better concurrency under multiple users, and native JSONB support for provider-specific metadata (Jira `cloudId`, Teams `tenantId`). SQLAlchemy async chosen over raw asyncpg for declarative models and migration support. The `DatabaseSettings` pool config (`pool_size`, `max_overflow`) already exists in `config.py`.
**Status**: Planned for Phase 7.0.
